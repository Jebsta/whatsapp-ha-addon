## What is this add-on?
This add-on is a wrapper for the [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) library. It allows you to send and receive messages from WhatsApp through Home Assistant.

## How to use
1. Add repository to Home Assistant ([Instructions here](../../../#readme))
2. Install the add-on
3. Start the add-on
5. Open the web interface http://<your_ha_ip>:3000
6. Scan the QR code
7. Add the rest commands to Home Assistant configuration.yaml

### **How to get a User ID**

The user id is made from three parts:

- Country code (Example `34` for Spain)
- Phone number (Example `123456789`)
- And a static part: @c.us (for users) @g.us (for groups)

So, if you want to send a message to a user with number `123456789` and country code `34`, the user id will be `34123456789@c.us` (the `@c.us` part is static)

<br>

## Configuration
Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
rest_command:
    whatsapp_send_text_message:
        url: http://<your_ha_ip>:3000/api/messages
        method: POST
        headers:
            Content-Type: application/json
        payload: '{"to": "{{ to }}", "msg": "{{ message }}"}'

    # Send a file, e.g. a picture
    whatsapp_send_media_message:
        url: http://<your_ha_ip>:3000/api/messages
        method: POST
        headers:
            Content-Type: application/json
        payload: '{"to": "{{ to }}", "url": "{{ url }}"}'
```

## Example usage
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Send a message
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.motion_sensor_158d0001c0b2b2
        to: 'on'
    action:
      - service: rest_command.whatsapp_send_text_message
        data:
          #  sending to +1 22222222
          to: "122222222"
          message: "Someone is at the door!"
```

## Reciving messages
The add-on will send events to Home Assistant when a message is received.
